FOR PORTFOLIO sql, the data pull is from this website https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths where I learn Data Exploring with SQL
With abit of fine tuning in excel, I was able to import to sql and explore based on the data
FOR PORTFOLIO DATA CLEANING, i pull the data from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx . I learn to clean the data, for example, the property address were mixed up with city and state, which then were split for easier understanding. Also converted the date format.


All of this were done with the guidance from ALEX THE ANALYST on Youtube = https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst
